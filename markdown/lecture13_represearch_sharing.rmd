#### PURPOSE

In the last lecture on reproducible research, we discussed version
control through git. Git works better with some types of file formats
than others (e.g., plain text vs. MS Word). Today we will discuss a
few of these not only in the service of using git, but with the
purpose of improving how you can collaborate with others and share
your work. We'll also discuss attributions and ownership.

## The common thread

Despite their seemingly different approaches to structuring text, the
following syntaxes share two primary characteristics:

1. They are structured and saved using plain text files
2. They follow a *WYSIWYM* rather than *WYSIWYG* philosophy

### Plain text

The simple MS Word `.doc` or `.docx` is a single file, right? Yes and
no. The reason non-PC systems sometimes have trouble with MS Word
documents is (1) they are saved in a proprietary format, and (2) those files are
better thought of as file systems rather than as a single file. In other
words, your MS Word document isn't simply a record of the words on
your screen, but also of a large number of format and
system settings. This file structure is why, if you have tried,
GitHub doesn't display Windows documents that you may have pushed to
it.

Git works best with plain text (ASCII) files. There are a limited
number of characters available, but for most of your scripting, you'll
be fine (do you really need that umlaut in your variable names?). 

### WYSIWYG vs WYSIWYM

Huh? WYSIWYG and WYSIWYM, respectively, stand for:

* **W**hat **Y**ou **S**ee **I**s **W**hat **Y**ou **G**et  
* **W**hat **Y**ou **S**ee **I**s **W**hat **Y**ou **M**ean

It's the last word, *get* vs *mean*, that makes the difference. MS
Word is WYSIWYG. The content and the formatting are combined. HTML,
for example, is WYSIWYM, meaning that the formatting is called only at
the end, as the final document is assembled. In reality the difference
between WYSIWYG and WYSIWYM isn't binary,
either/or. Rather the *get* and *mean* exist on ends of a spectrum. On
the far *get* side, MS Word. On the far *mean* side, LaTeX. Each has
its benefits and drawbacks. But for reproducible documents that
facilitate version control and collaborative sharing, WYSIWYM is the rule.

## Writing

There are a number of syntaxes that you can use when producing
text. We'll go through each below, roughly from least to most complex.

### Plain text

You can always write in plain text. Your Stata .do files are in plain
text; the only difference is instead of saving them with a `.txt`
ending, we save them with `.do` so that Stata knows what they are and
how to treat them.

Your computer likely has a text editor already installed. Some allow
you write in rich text. Turn that off if you want pure plain
text. More sophisticated editors such as
[emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)/[aquamacs](http://aquamacs.org/)
and [vim](http://www.vim.org/download.php) offer 
powerful functionality above and beyond those found in a simple text editor. [Now that
the editor wars are largely over](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war),
you can pick anything you want and still be a "real" programmer.

For quick notes, embrace plain text. Do you really need everything
formatted just so for something that only you or a small number of
people will see? Probably not. So stop focusing on the margins and
just type!

### Markdown

Okay, sometimes you want a little formatting. For that you have
Markdown. Originated by John Gruber in 2004,

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown
> allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text
> format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

*Source:* [http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/]()

In the years since, Markdown has become one of the default syntaxes
for web-based documents. GitHub makes extensive use of Markdown, both
in its README files (hence the `.md` ending) and on its website. This
course website was compiled using Markdown. Though originally intended
to convert plain text to HTML, most markdown editors will export PDF
documents as well.

To use Markdown on your computer, you will need to download and save
it per instructions found online. But lucky for us, we can play with
Markdown in our web browser via the site
[Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/).  

### LaTeX

Let's get this out of the way: LaTeX is a pain. Why even bother? This
chart pretty much sums it up:

So for small documents, LaTeX isn't worth it. But as your documents
become more complex or if you wish to follow the philosophy of
[literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming),
then learning LaTeX is on your horizon. TeX and its variants hew
closely to the WYSIWYM ideal. Formatting requires tags around the
relevant text and the loading of special packages for extended
features. The end result of an uncompiled `.tex` document is almost
unreadable, but it succeeds at giving the writer almost complete
control of the formatting process while separating it from the
content.  

Discussing the finer points of LaTeX are outside of the scope of this
course. If you want to try it, you'll need to load a TeX engine on
your computer. Luckily, people have put together packages
that not only install TeX on your machine, but also include editors to
make your life a little easier. I've also put together a
[getting started with LaTeX document](https://github.com/btskinner/latex_example)
that you may find helpful. If nothing else, it will give you links to
download the proper TeX distribution for your machine.

To give you just a quick idea of how LaTeX works, visit
[https://tex.mendelu.cz/en/]() and paste the following code in the
window (be sure to select *3* passes before compiling):

```
\documentclass{article} 
\begin{document} 

\begin{center}
{\Huge Title}
\end{center}

\section{First Section}

This is the first section.

\subsection{First subsection}

This is the first subsection.

Here's another paragraph, this time indented.

\subsection{Second subsection}

\begin{enumerate}
\item one
\item two
\item three
\begin{itemize}
\item three.i
\item three.ii
\item three.iii
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Second Section}

See Table \ref{tab:one} below.

\begin{table}[!h]
\caption{A table}
\label{tab:one}
\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
\hline
Letter & Number & Greek: Upper & Greek: Lower \\
\hline
A & 1 &  & \alpha \\
B & 2 &  & \beta \\
C & 3 & \Gamma & \gamma \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\end{document}
```

## Equations

Even if you decide that LaTeX is more trouble than it's worth, you
would still do well to learn how to write equations in it. All those
fancy math books with the well-formatted equations? LaTeX. MS Word has
an equation editor, but it can be frustrating. Take the time to learn
the syntax and you'll be able to format clean equations for your
presentations and papers (even if you choose to import them as image
files).

With LaTeX syntax, this

```
f(x \mid \mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
```
becomes

<div style="font-size: 150%;">
\[
f(x \mid \mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
\]
</div>

The good news is that you can use this syntax in Markdown with
[MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/). Again, this might be overkill for
a quick note, but when your equation need to be correct, knowing how
this syntax is structured is invaluable. There are a number of online equation
editors that will let you download your finished equation as an image
file. [Here is one](https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php).

## References

At this point, you likely have some system for managing your
references. Many good standalone programs and browser extensions are
available such as [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) and
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). If you choose to use LaTeX, its
reference system uses [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/) to add your
inline citations and produce a nicely formatted bibliography. Like our
discussion about LaTeX in general, BibTeX gives the most flexibility
but at the highest start up cost. 

### `*.bib` files

Even if you don't choose to use BibTeX, you should know about its
basic database file type, the `*.bib` file. All other reference
management systems will import and export bib files. Why should you
care? Because a bib file is simply a text file that organizes
references by their constitutive parts. For example:

```
@article{knuth1984literate,
  title={Literate Programming},
  author={Knuth, Donald Ervin},
  journal={The Computer Journal},
  volume={27},
  number={2},
  pages={97--111},
  year={1984},
  doi={10.1093/comjnl/27.2.97}
}
```
With the `@` sign, the entry tells us what type of reference it
is. Immediately following the open bracket is the key, which
many programs use to call the reference. Everything else together
comprises the relevant parts of the citation. 

What's missing? The format. We don't need it. That can be set
later. The important point is that our citation is ready to be used
and can be shared easily with someone else. Even a bib file with nearly a
thousand references (my general archive file) is only around 2.5 MB.

## Graphics

You will produce a lot of plots in your research. You will likely make
a poster or two for conferences. People may ask you for a copy of your
cool graph
or even your poster. Two important things to keep in mind: the format
of the file and making sure you get attribution.

In terms of formatting, the primary consideration is choosing between raster
and vector graphics. I'll briefly discuss the ideas behind each
below. 

### Raster

Raster graphics produce their images by manipulating cells in a
grid. Each cell is given a certain value in terms of color/brightness
and the sum total of cells produces the image. As the number of cells
increase, so does the potential resolution as well as the file size.

The inherent problem with raster graphics is that they don't scale
up. So you if save a graph in the `.jpg` format and later need to
enlarge it, you'll notice some pixelation. This is because you no
longer have enough cells per unit of measure to have the resolution
you want. Some programs will try to solve this problem by
interpolating new cells based on surrounding values, but the results
aren't always great.

Save your headshot in a high quality `.tiff` file and give people a
decently sized `.jpg` if they ask. Otherwise, no rasters.

#### Common types

* `.bmp`
* `.gif`
* `.jpg/.jpeg`
* `.tiff`

### Vector

Vector graphics use equations to model the image they produce. Because
of this, they are infinitely expandable. They are often smaller in
size than similar raster images, though not always. They don't offer
the level of detail that raster images can produce, but unless you
need photorealistic images, that's not a concern. In our case, vector
images might even be clearer as they model the lines of our plots with
equations and are therefore only limited in resolution by the display
and not the number of sampled grid cells.

One important point to remember with vector graphics: they are often
produced in layers. This means that a plot with a thousand data points
has at least a thousand layers unless you flatten it. This is one of
those situations where the vector image file could balloon in size
beyond that of a raster image.

Most of your plots should be in some vector format.

#### Common types

* `.pdf`
* `.png`
* `.ps/.eps`
* `.svg`

## Attribution

The internet is still the wild west in terms of
copyright. At worst unscrupulous people will take credit for your work.

<br>

When you feel ready to share your work with the wider world (which
includes posting it on your website), be sure to have your name on
it. This won't stop someone who really wants to pass off your work as
his or her own, but it is a first step. Stealing code is much easier to do 
since a person can just remove your name from the file. With images,
make sure your name is part of the image itself. This will make sure
that someone who simply downloads your files or links to it will have
cite you, if for no other reason than your name is on it.

All this goes without saying that you should similarly credit the work
of others, even if it's just found on the internet.

## Ownership

Another aspect of attribution is ownership. When attributing work to
someone, you make a claim of ownership on his or her behalf. This
means that you have to understand who owns the work and under what
conditions. Very rarely will you have a situation in which someone
writes a bit of code, builds a dataset, or creates a graphic, and then
formally transfers ownership rights to you to do as you will. There
will be restrictions concerning when, how, and under what conditions you can
use the product. Only because of the free-wheeling nature of the
internet and lax understanding of copyright do people feel as free to
borrow as they do.

### Licenses

Maybe you've seen software described as *open source* or seen some
code as falling under the *GNU General Public License v3 (GPL-3)* or
*MIT
License*. [While both of the licenses describe works that you are allowed to copy for free (as in beer), they have different rules regarding how free (as in speech) you are to use them.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre#.22Free_beer.22_vs_.22free_speech.22_distinction)
Many other licenses exist. Some allow you to incorporate the free code
into a proprietary program; others say the free code is like
[ice-nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice-nine) in that all other
code it touches will itself fall under the same license (not so good
if you wanted to sell it).

Be aware of the license that other code/images/data fall under when
attempting to use. Most snippets and items you find won't come with
any license. This does not mean you can just take it! The assumption,
unless told otherwise, is that it belongs to the original owner. Ask
permission!

As far as your files, decide if and how you want to
share. [tldrlegal.com](https://tldrlegal.com/) will give you a nice
summary of various software licenses. GitHub has common license files
ready to add to your project. You aren't a bad person if you don't
want to share, but don't expect any party invites from
[Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman).

But before you run off to share everything...

### Collaboration and sharing

Are you working on someone else's project? Is some organization
funding this project with grant money? Are you using sensitive or
restricted data? If the answer to any of these questions is *yes* or
even, *I think so?*, then don't share unless you have express
permission to do so. And if given permission, make sure you abide by
the conditions of that permission.


## Final word

Do you have to use git, LaTeX, markdown, etc. or make all of your work
free in order to be a good researcher? No. If you do these things, are
you thereby a good researcher? Not necessarily. The point in
introducing you to these various syntaxes, techniques, and
philosophies is not to say that "this is the **one** way to do
research" but rather to offer what might be a better way. Pick and
choose from these techniques and others as you need, but actively
choose something. MS Word and Dropbox may work fine...for now. Or
maybe forever. But don't let them be your default simply because you
don't know anything else.
